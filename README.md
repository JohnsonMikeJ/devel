## My Developmental tidbits.
I'm in the process of updating my development environment and process so
though these files work for me, they may not work for you. This is not a
bug :/

## ~/git
.gitignore, hooks, aliases, etc.

## ~/home
.bascrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig, .bash_aliases, other dotfiles, etc.

# My Vagrant boxes
Well more specifically, my Vagrantfile's and provisioning crap. Actual Vagrant boxes are hosted on S3 (linked in each Vagrantfile) because hosting files that size on GitHub is a PITA and S3 is cheaper.

Each subdirectory should have it's own README.md file - if not its likely listed below

## provisioning-scripts/
I would imagine that the directory name is explanatory in itself.
